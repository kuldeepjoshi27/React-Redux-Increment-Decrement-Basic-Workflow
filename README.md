# 📘 React + Redux (Core Redux) — Basic Counter App

A simple React application demonstrating how **Redux works without Redux Toolkit**.  
This project explains core Redux concepts like **Store, Reducer, Actions, Dispatch**, and how React interacts with Redux using **useSelector** and **useDispatch**.

## 🚀 Tech Used
- **React (CRA)**
- **Redux (Core)**
- **React-Redux**
- **CSS (basic styling)**
